# Flights Norway
Flights Norway is a simple mobile app showing you
arrivals and departures information from all Norwegian airports. 
The app is availble for Android (Mono for Android), iOS (MonoTouch)
and Windows Phone 7.

The app is implemented following the MVVM design pattern, and is ment
as an example of how you can build cross-platform mobile applications 
using .NET.

## Workshop Branch
The main branch of the repository contains the completed apps.
There is an additional [workshop branch](https://github.com/follesoe/FlightsNorway/tree/workshop) hosting a 50+ page 
step-by-step tutorial on how to build cross-platform mobile apps. The
branch is tagged using GIT tags to provide starting points for each
step of the tutorial.
