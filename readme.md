# Cross platform mobile apps using .NET tutorial
The workshop-branch of the repository contains an end-to-end tutorial for 
building a cross-platform mobile app using C#, MonoTouch, Mono for Android 
and Windows Phone 7. The tutorial consists of a [PDF document giving you a 
step-by-step guide from scratch to a complete app](https://github.com/follesoe/FlightsNorway/raw/workshop/Docs/Workshop%20Material.pdf).
There is also a [PowerPoint presentation supporting the tutorial](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7788914/Workshop%20Material.pptx), 
but not all slides are translated to English yet.

The branch also has a set of tags defining completed sections for the 
tutorial. These can be used to "jump" to a given state of the tutorial.
